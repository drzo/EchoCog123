Core Components:
- Memory Hub with centralized API/database
- Access Protocol for memory operations
- Real-time synchronization across instances
- Context management and monitoring
- Storage system with version control


I've built a distributed memory management system called EchoCog with these key features:

Architecture:
- Central Memory Hub with API/DB
- Memory Access Protocol
- Real-time sync between instances
- Context management
- Versioned storage

Implementation Details:

1. Memory Store
- State: Zustand + Immer
- Storage: IndexedDB (Dexie)
- Memory categorization
- Version control
- Batch operations
- Search/tagging system

2. Sync System
- RxJS for real-time sync
- Event-based architecture
- Instance health monitoring
- Conflict resolution
- Broadcast filtering

3. Context Management
- React Context for global state
- Memory stacks
- Tag-based management
- Provider components

4. Monitoring
- Real-time metrics
- Performance tracking
- Load calculation
- Memory distribution stats
- History tracking

5. Code Organization
- TypeScript interfaces in types.ts
- Custom hooks (useMemory, useMetrics)
- Services directory (monitor, sync)
- Utility functions
- Constants management
- ESM configuration

The system is optimized for performance and maintainability. Development server is running with PostCSS and Tailwind properly configured.
